# Simple-Neural-Network
This is a simple Neural Network, with two inputs, one hidden layer an an output. I train the network with stochastic gradient descent in order to update the bias and the weights and I use a sigmoid function as the activation function. Since this network is not a recurrent model, it has a fixed nimber of inputs and outputs, in this case two inputs and one output.
